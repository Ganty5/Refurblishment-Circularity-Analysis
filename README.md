# Refurbishment and Circularity Analysis (Real-World dataset used)
Source of data: ereuse.org

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the condition and circularity of refurbished devices to promote sustainable practices. By leveraging Python for data analysis and automation and Power BI for creation of interactive dashboards. The aim is 
to extract insights that align with circular economy principles. This project is particularly useful for industries which specialize in refurbished electronics. 

**About the Dataset**
The dataset used in this project was sourced from eReuse.org, a platform dedicated to promoting the reuse and refurbishment of electronic devices. eReuse.org works to foster circular economy practices by connecting stakeholders in the reuse and recycling ecosystem. This ensures that electronic devices are reused to their full potential before being recycled, reducing electronic waste and promoting sustainability.

**The dataset provides comprehensive information about various electronic devices and their conditions, making it highly relevant for analyzing circularity practices. Key features of the dataset include:**

**Type and Subtype**: Categorizes devices by their general type (e.g., laptop, netbook, etc.).
**Model and Manufacturer**: Offers detailed insights into device brands and models, such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and others.
**Processor, RAM, and HDD**: Technical details, including processor type, RAM size (in GB), and storage capacity (in MB).
R**egistered Date:** Indicates when the device was added to the database.
**Condition Score**: A numeric score (from 1 to 5) that evaluates the device's condition, with 5 being excellent.
**Condition**: A qualitative label (e.g., high, medium, low, or discard) that corresponds to the condition score.

**PROJECT GOALS**
- Evaluate and categorize the condition of devices for circularity.
- Provide actionable insights to enhance refurbished device management.
- Build visualizations and dashboards to track key performance indicators (KPIs) that promote sustainability.

OBJECTIVES
- Clean the data to ensure data accuracy by handling missing values and irrelevant columns.
- Perform Condition Categorization, grouping devices into meaningful categories such as:
   High: Ready for resale with minimal refurbishment.
   Medium: Requires some refurbishment but is functional.
   Low: May need significant repairs but can still be reused.
   Discard: Non-functional and unsalvageable.
- Correlation Analysis to understand how features like RAM size, storage, and condition score influence device quality.
- Develop visualizations by Creating clear, interactive visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
- Build a Dashboard Using Power BI to design a professional dashboard showcasing KPIs.

**PROCESS BREAKDOWN**
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Condition Categorization
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Visualization
6. KPI Dashboard Design
7. Automation

**CONCLUSION**
Refurbished devices reduce e-waste and align with sustainable practices. By analyzing the conditions of these devices, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve refurbishment efficiency and promote a circular economy. This project demonstrates how a data-driven approach can provide actionable insights to support sustainability goals.
